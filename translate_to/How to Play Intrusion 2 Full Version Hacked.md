Intrusion 2 is not an easy game, especially on higher difficulty levels. You will face many challenges and enemies that will test your skills and reflexes. Here are some gameplay tips that might help you survive and enjoy the game more:

- Use cover and dodge often. The enemies have good aim and can deal a lot of damage in a short time. You can hide behind crates, rocks, trees and other objects to avoid their fire. You can also roll, jump and slide to evade their attacks. Be aware of your surroundings and don't get cornered or trapped.
- Experiment with different weapons and vehicles. The game offers a variety of weapons, from pistols and rifles to rocket launchers and plasma guns. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages, such as range, accuracy, fire rate, damage and ammo capacity. Try to find the weapon that suits your play style and the situation best. You can also use vehicles, such as bikes, mechs and helicopters, to move faster and deal more damage. However, vehicles are not invincible and can be destroyed by enemy fire.
- Pay attention to the physics and animation. The game uses realistic physics and procedural animation to create dynamic and immersive gameplay. You can use the environment to your advantage, such as shooting barrels, crates or rocks to cause explosions or avalanches. You can also interact with objects, such as grabbing ropes, swinging on vines or riding on animals. The enemies also react to the physics and animation, such as falling down, losing limbs or getting stunned.
- Save your progress frequently. The game has checkpoints that allow you to save your progress and resume from there if you die. However, checkpoints are not always close to each other and sometimes you might have to replay a long section of the game if you die. To avoid frustration, you can manually save your progress by pressing Esc and selecting Save Game. You can also load your previous save by pressing Esc and selecting Load Game.

Intrusion 2 is a fun and challenging game that will keep you entertained for hours. If you follow these tips, you might have an easier time playing it and enjoy it more.
